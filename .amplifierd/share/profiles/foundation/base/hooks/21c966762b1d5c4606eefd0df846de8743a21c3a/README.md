# amplifier-module-hooks-status-context

Injects environment info (working directory, platform, OS, date) and optional git status into agent context before each prompt. Ensures agent has fresh contextual information for decisions.

## Usage

```yaml
hooks:
  - module: hooks-status-context
    source: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-module-hooks-status-context@main
    config:
      include_git: true                # Enable git status (default: true)
      git_include_status: true         # Show working dir status (default: true)
      git_include_commits: 5           # Recent commits count (default: 5, 0=disable)
      git_include_branch: true         # Show current branch (default: true)
      git_include_main_branch: true    # Detect main branch (default: true)
      include_datetime: true           # Show date/time (default: true)
      datetime_include_timezone: false # Include TZ name (default: false)
```
