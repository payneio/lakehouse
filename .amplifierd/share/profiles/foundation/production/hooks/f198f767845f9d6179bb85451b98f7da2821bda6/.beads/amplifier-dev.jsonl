Need to investigate why handle_content_block_start/end handlers aren't firing or aren't displaying output.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-12T07:55:30.365303564-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-12T12:26:23.06651592-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-12T12:26:23.06651592-08:00"}
