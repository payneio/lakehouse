# Amplifier Cost-Aware Scheduler Module

Cost and latency aware scheduling for tool and agent selection in Amplifier.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** - Fast Python package manager

### Installing UV

```bash
# macOS/Linux/WSL
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

## Purpose

Optimizes tool and agent selection based on cost and latency metrics to improve performance and reduce operational costs.

## Contract

**Module Type:** Hook
**Mount Point:** `hooks` registry
**Entry Point:** `amplifier_module_hooks_scheduler_cost_aware:mount`

## Configuration

```toml
[[hooks]]
module = "hooks-scheduler-cost-aware"
config = {
    cost_weight = 0.6      # Weight for cost optimization (0.0-1.0)
    latency_weight = 0.4   # Weight for latency optimization (0.0-1.0)
}
```

## Behavior

Registers handlers for decision events:

- `decision:tool_resolution` - Select tool based on cost/latency optimization
- `decision:agent_resolution` - Select agent considering resource costs
- `decision:context_resolution` - Optimize context compaction decisions

Returns resolution responses with:

- Selected option
- Optimization score (0.0-1.0)
- Cost-based rationale
- Metadata including weights used

## Dependencies

- `amplifier-core>=1.0.0`
