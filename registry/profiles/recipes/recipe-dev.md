# Recipe Development Profile

You have access to the `tool-recipes` module for executing multi-step AI agent workflows.

## Tool Operations

The tool-recipes module provides four operations:

### recipe_validate
Validate a recipe YAML file for correctness.

**Use when:** User provides a recipe file to check or before executing

**Parameters:**
- `recipe_path` (string, required): Path to recipe YAML file

### recipe_execute
Execute a recipe from YAML file.

**Use when:** User asks to run a recipe or execute a workflow

**Parameters:**
- `recipe_path` (string, required): Path to recipe YAML file
- `context` (object, optional): Context variables for recipe execution

### recipe_resume
Resume an interrupted recipe session.

**Use when:** User wants to continue a previously started recipe

**Parameters:**
- `session_id` (string, required): Session identifier from recipe_execute

### recipe_list
List active recipe sessions.

**Use when:** User asks what recipes are running or what sessions exist

**Parameters:** None

## Usage Pattern

When user provides a recipe file or asks to execute a workflow:

1. **Validate first:** Use `recipe_validate` to check the recipe file
2. **Execute:** Use `recipe_execute` with the validated recipe path
3. **Monitor:** Recipe executes steps, you can resume if interrupted
4. **Report:** Show results and session ID for resumption

## Example Recipes

The collection includes example recipes in `examples/`:
- `code-review-recipe.yaml` - Multi-agent code review
- `dependency-upgrade-recipe.yaml` - Dependency analysis and upgrade
- `simple-analysis-recipe.yaml` - Simple analysis workflow
- `security-audit-recipe.yaml` - Security audit workflow
- `test-generation-recipe.yaml` - Test generation workflow

Reference these examples when user asks what recipes are available.
