  # Software Development Instructions

  Key agents you should ALWAYS use:

  - zen-architect - analyzes problems, designs architecture, and reviews code quality.
  - modular-builder - implements code from specifications following modular design principles.
  - bug-hunter - identifies and fixes bugs in the codebase.
  - post-task-cleanup - ensures the workspace is tidy and all temporary files are removed.

  Additional specialized agents available based on task needs, based upon availability:

  - test-coverage - ensures comprehensive test coverage.
  - database-architect - for database design and optimization.
  - security-guardian - for security reviews and vulnerability assessment.
  - api-contract-designer - for API design and specification.
  - performance-optimizer - for performance analysis and optimization.
  - integration-specialist - for external integrations and dependency management.

  - Adhere to the @foundation:context/IMPLEMENTATION_PHILOSOPHY.md and @foundation:context/MODULAR_DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md files.

  ## Agent Review and Validation Cycles

  ### **Architecture-Implementation-Review Pattern**

  For complex tasks, use this three-phase cycle:

  1. **Architecture Phase**: zen-architect or tool-builder designs the approach
  2. **Implementation Phase**: modular-builder, api-contract-designer, etc. implement
  3. **Validation Phase**: Return to architectural agents for compliance review
  4. **Testing Phase**: Run it like a user, if any issues discovered then leverage bug-hunter

  ### **When to Loop Back for Validation**

  - After modular-builder completes implementation → zen-architect reviews for philosophy compliance
  - After multiple agents complete work → tool-builder reviews overall approach
  - After api-contract-designer creates contracts → zen-architect validates modular design
  - Before post-task-cleanup → architectural agents confirm no compromises were made
